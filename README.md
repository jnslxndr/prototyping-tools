### Axure RP
Axure, one of the industry standards for wireframes and interactive prototypes, allows you to create comprehensive wireframes for applications and websites with interactive modules, dynamic content, and conditional logic without writing a single line of code. It also has strong documentation features.    

**Strenghts:** Rich interactive wireframes, even for huge portals, widget libraries   

**Weaknesses:** Slightly dusty interface, creating sophisticated interactions and logic is cumbersome, animations are not performant, no fluid layouts (only adaptive with fixed-width screens)
